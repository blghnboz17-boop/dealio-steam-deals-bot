# Project Instructions

## Goal

Dealio is a personal Steam price assistant inside Discord. It follows a user's
public Steam wishlist and sends direct messages when a game matches the user's
own price rules, with the context needed to trust the alert.

## Rules

- Use TypeScript with strict mode.
- Keep Steam, Discord, persistence, and scheduling code in separate modules (`src/steam`, `src/discord`, `src/persistence`, `src/application`, `src/domain`, `src/operations`, `src/price-history`, `src/admin`; the admin panel UI lives in `admin-ui/`).
- Never commit secrets. Read tokens and IDs from environment variables.
- Use Node's built-in `node:sqlite` module; avoid native database dependencies.
- Add tests for price-change, rule-matching, and duplicate-notification logic.
- External requests must have timeouts and must not turn an unavailable API into a false sale.
- Persist sale candidates and delivery attempts before calling Discord. Delivery is at-least-once, never promised as exactly-once.
- Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` after implementation changes. `npm run typecheck:scenarios` and `npm run build` must also pass before a release.

## Current Scope

Dealio is in **limited beta** on a single Azure VM. Implemented:

- Three commands: `/dealio` (the panel: Home, Wishlist, Alerts, Settings), `/setup` and `/delete-data`; retired shortcuts open the panel. Per-user setup, Steam Store country and language, Turkish, English, German and French panels (Discord Components V2; every text is a `{ tr, en, de, fr }` entry, see `src/discord/i18n.ts`).
- Polling waits thirty minutes after a completed scan by default (`POLL_INTERVAL_HOURS=0.5`), and a scan also runs two minutes after Steam's daily price change at 10:00 Pacific, which no cached price outlives (`src/domain/steam-price-schedule.ts`); notification retries run independently every 60 seconds. This is polling, not a Steam event feed.
- Per-game rules: inherit the global discount threshold, a game-specific percentage, or a currency-bound target price; muting is independent.
- Notify when a sale starts or crosses a rule threshold, and again in the same sale only when it gets clearly deeper (≥10 more discount points; a met target ≥10% lower). Setup, a newly seen game, saving a game rule and changing the default threshold all record the same baseline (`src/persistence/alert-levels.ts`) and never alert for what is already true; a waiting alert that no longer meets the rule is retired. A target left in an old currency falls back to the default discount rule until a new target is saved. Discord rate limits delay a send without using up delivery attempts.
- Notification timing: on detection, IANA-timezone quiet hours, or a daily digest. Pending offers are revalidated before delivery.
- Sale alerts and the Wishlist game detail show Steam's historical low (the detail also lists recent price changes) for the user's Store region from the IsThereAnyDeal API (optional `ITAD_API_KEY`; same currency only, never converted; after a regional currency switch such as Turkey's, the low since that switch; failures omit the line and never delay or block delivery).
- Alerts and the game detail show Steam's own Store context from the same metadata request: review summary, platforms, Steam Deck compatibility and the discount end time (all optional, omitted when Steam does not state them). A 100% discount is presented as a free game to keep. The detail offers a one-tap target at the IsThereAnyDeal low and a link that opens the game in the Steam app through `docs/open.html` on the public site.
- Unreleased games (no price until release), games not sold in the user's Store region and games removed from Steam are shown as such ("🗓️ Coming soon · date", "🚫 not sold", "🗑️ removed") and never count as unknown prices or failed items; only transient Steam failures make a check incomplete.
- Persistent deduplication per sale episode; a game absent from one wishlist read keeps its sale state for a 20-minute grace period, so Steam omissions never re-send an ongoing sale. Delivery history, DM access test, and `/delete-data` (recorded as a hashed entry in `data/deletions.jsonl`, re-applied at startup so a restore cannot undo it).
- Changing the Steam account from Settings reuses the setup profile form, needs confirmation, and starts the new wishlist from a baseline. New sign-ups are capped by `DEALIO_MAX_USERS` (default 200). The support link appears on the Home panel only, never in DMs.
- Price observations kept 90 days, notification history shown for 30 days; shared five-minute price cache.
- Owner admin panel (`docs/admin-panel.tr.md`): a web UI inside the bot process on 127.0.0.1 only, reached by SSH tunnel, enabled by `DEALIO_ADMIN_TOKEN`. Servers, users (live Discord profiles, never stored), games, usage telemetry (`interaction_event`, 90 days; server join/leave history), owner actions through the same services and per-user coordinator as commands (pause, check, test alert, region/language, block, delete), announcements and DMs persisted per recipient before Discord is called, runtime settings (sign-ups open, user limit override, presence), audit trail and logs. Blocked accounts can still run `/delete-data`. The privacy policy (6 October 2026) covers this data; keep it in sync when telemetry changes.
- Operations: encrypted off-site backup and restore rehearsal (GitHub Actions), independent Healthchecks alerts, a static public site (privacy, terms, help) on GitHub Pages, release gate (`npm run release:check`), and anonymous latency metrics (`npm run metrics:report`).

Out of scope: payments, a user-facing web dashboard (the owner admin panel is the only web UI), other stores, estimated currency conversion, Steam credentials or private wishlists, real-time Steam events.

## Operating Constraints

- Production is one Azure VM (`dealiobot`). Never run a second copy with the production Discord token; use a separate test application (`.env.test`, see `docs/development.md`).
- The VM has 1 GiB RAM: build, typecheck, and the full test suite run locally or in CI, not on the VM. Deploy a verified `dist` with `deploy/switch-release.sh` (see `deploy/README.tr.md`). The bot runs with `node --optimize-for-size`, a 1 GB swap file, `OOMScoreAdjust=-500` and lean discord.js caches (`src/discord/client.ts`); do not run other long-lived tools on the VM.
- No paid cloud resources. Azure Blob leasing and the Bicep template exist in code but are not provisioned; the single-host machine-ID pin and process lock protect production.
- The subscription is Azure for Students (credit expires 7 Sep 2027). Keep the VM at `Standard_B2ats_v2` and the OS disk at 64 GiB P6: both are in the free services, while the "cheapest" list sizes such as `B2ts_v2` are not. New resources must use an allowed region (Sweden Central for this bot; `Global` for alert action groups). Details: `deploy/FREE-OPERATIONS.tr.md`.
- The general public release gate is closed. Phase 4 (real-user acceptance) is in progress; see `docs/phase4-beta.tr.md` for scenarios, measurement rules, and results. Do not widen access or claim desktop/mobile, English, or one-week acceptance without real evidence and the owner's approval. The owner shares invitations; never message users on your own.
- Evidence and acceptance records live in `docs/` and `deploy/`; do not mark a gate as passed without a recorded real run.
