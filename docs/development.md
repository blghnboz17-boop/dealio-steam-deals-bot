# Development

## Isolated setup

Use Node.js **22.16 or later**. CI checks Node.js 22 and 24. The source repository is private; access to it is separate from installing the hosted bot.

Create a **separate Discord application** for development. Enable both **Guild Install** and **User Install** in its installation settings; the command definitions support both. A production token must never be used for local testing.

From a repository checkout on Linux or WSL:

```bash
npm ci
[ -e .env.test ] || install -m 600 .env.test.example .env.test
```

Create the test file once; do not overwrite an existing configured file. Enter the test application's `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` directly in `.env.test`. Do not paste tokens into a chat, a commit, or a screenshot.

The template uses a separate SQLite database at `./data/test-wishlist.db`. Leave `DEALIO_PRODUCTION=false` and keep the real production application ID in `PRODUCTION_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`. Local startup rejects that production ID.

```bash
DOTENV_CONFIG_PATH=.env.test npm run dev
```

Install the test application in a test server, then run `/setup` and `/dealio`. No privileged Discord gateway intents are required. An optional `STEAM_WEB_API_KEY` enables vanity-name resolution; numeric SteamID64 and numeric profile links do not require it. An optional `ITAD_API_KEY` (free, from https://isthereanydeal.com/apps/my/) adds Steam's historical low price to sale alerts; without it alerts are unchanged.

## Verify changes

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run typecheck:scenarios
npm test
npm run build
```

`npm test` builds first (`pretest`) and runs the full suite. A successful build alone is not a substitute for these checks.

For a built local test process:

```bash
DOTENV_CONFIG_PATH=.env.test npm start
```

Use one process per test application. Discord component sessions are in memory, so open fresh panels after a restart.

## UI review

`npm run preview:ui` generates an approximate local page from the component builders and demo data. Its renderers may lag newer panels; it is not a complete Discord renderer. Use Discord desktop and mobile for final acceptance, including nested buttons, modals, themes, expiry, error states, and a real DM test.

## Production modes

The existing Azure VM is the sole production host. Production uses `DEALIO_PRODUCTION=true` and an explicitly pinned `DEALIO_SINGLE_HOST_MACHINE_ID`. Startup checks `/etc/machine-id`; a local application-ID lock also rejects a second process using a different database under the same OS user.

This is **not** a distributed lock. Cloned machine identities or separate OS users are outside that guarantee.

An optional cloud mode uses `AZURE_LEASE_CONTAINER_URL` and a pre-provisioned application lock blob; uncertain lease renewal disconnects the bot. It is implemented but **not provisioned**, because the project uses no paid cloud resources.

Backups, restore rehearsal, independent alerts, and the public legal pages are already running; see [free operations](../deploy/FREE-OPERATIONS.tr.md), [the deployment guide](../deploy/README.tr.md) (build locally, never on the 1 GiB VM). Restore matching code **and database** when rolling back across a schema migration. Do not include `.env` in backup archives.

Useful scripts: `npm run release:check <evidence.json>` (release gate), `npm run metrics:report` (anonymous latency summary), `npm run monitor:preview` (read-only monitor preview), `npm run backup` / `npm run restore:test` (local backup and restore test), and `npm run test:capacity` (capacity check).

## Secrets and repository hygiene

- `.env` and `.env.test` are ignored; commit only example files.
- Keep databases, runtime files, tokens, and private user data out of the repository.
- An MIT license file does not make a private repository publicly browsable.
- Docs-only changes need link/content/render checks; runtime changes require the project checks above.
